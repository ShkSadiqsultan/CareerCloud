CareerCloud is a layered architecture .NET solution designed for seamless and efficient data management. It integrates multiple technologies such as ADO.NET, Entity Framework, and gRPC to provide a comprehensive solution for business logic, data access, and communication.

Project Overview
The solution is organized into 7 layers, each with a specific role to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability:

CareerCloud.ADODataLayer
CareerCloud.BusinessLogicLayer
CareerCloud.DataAccessLayer
CareerCloud.EFDataAccessLayer
CareerCloud.gRPC
CareerCloud.Pocos
CareerCloud.WebAPI
Layer Descriptions

1. CareerCloud.ADODataLayer
Purpose: Handles all database interactions using ADO.NET.
Technology: ADO.NET.

2. CareerCloud.BusinessLogicLayer
Purpose: Implements business logic to validate and process data before interacting with the data access layers.
Key Features:
Acts as a bridge between the presentation layer (WebAPI) and the data layers.
Technology: Standard C# classes for logic implementation.

3. CareerCloud.DataAccessLayer
Purpose: Provides interfaces and base classes for data access.
Key Features:
Defines contracts for data access methods.
Acts as an abstraction layer between the business logic and data storage technologies (e.g., ADO.NET, EF).
Technology: C# interfaces and classes.

4. CareerCloud.EFDataAccessLayer
Purpose: Uses Entity Framework Core to perform database operations with a higher level of abstraction.
Key Features:
Simplifies data access with LINQ queries.
Technology: Entity Framework Core.

5. CareerCloud.gRPC
Purpose: Implements gRPC services for efficient communication between distributed systems.
Key Features:
Provides RPC methods to interact with CareerCloud's business logic.
Ensures fast, low-latency communication using Protocol Buffers.
Technology: gRPC with Protocol Buffers.

6. CareerCloud.Pocos
Purpose: Contains Plain Old CLR Objects (POCOs) representing database entities.
Key Features:
Models every table in the database as a C# class.
Serves as a shared model for consistency across all layers.
Technology: C# POCO classes.

7. CareerCloud.WebAPI
Purpose: Exposes RESTful endpoints for the CareerCloud application.
Key Features:
Integrates with the business logic layer to handle API requests.
Provides CRUD operations for various entities.
Technology: ASP.NET Web API.
